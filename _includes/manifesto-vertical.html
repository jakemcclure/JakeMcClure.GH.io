      <p>Although software continues to dominate in the tech space for other economical sectors, medical records systems in healthcare are borderline prehistoric. At a minimum, physicians and nurses remain frustrated; however, EMR-related frustration continues to increase its contribution toward physician burnout.

      <h3>Something's Gotta Give</h3>
      <p>The reality that a significant number of physicians would leave the healthcare profession altogether should serve as enough evidence warranting a shift in our HIT trajectory. As an industry we already are laggards in adoption. Instead of playing tech catch up, we need to hop out of line, go around all the noise, and get in line with the pack of developers who are in their infancy implementing Progressive Web Apps.

      <h3>Progressive Web Apps</h3>
      <p>EMR attempt 1.0 has been an utter failure when it comes to usability. In pursuit of onboarding the entirety of our health systems' healthcare providers, the functionality is incredibly complex, visually-congested and without any semblence of customized to the user. Healthcare honestly couldn't even define what "UX" actually represents.
      <p>We need to start focusing on the niche of <strong>progressive web apps</strong>. By the time we successfully are able to scale functional "apps", the rest of the mobile tech community will be on to something new. Our historical track record with regard to tentative adoption innovative IT solutions is enough convincing evidence for me.
      <p>So, I propose that we start over. Healthcare tech is a tortoise in a hare's race. We need to abandon the notion that building <strong>native apps</strong> for mobile is the answer for improving population health and patient engagement.
      <p>Progressive web apps offer browser-like speed & loading time while within the UI shell typical of native apps. These browser-friendly, lightning-fast apps are mobile, offline first.

      <h3>Portability via Open Notes</h3>

      <h3>UX</h3>
      <p>While the rest of the digital world has been focusing on the user interface and experience with their designed products, the healthcare tech seemingly is just now learning what the two-letter UI or UX even mean.
      <p>Worse, the entire meaningful use with EMR 1.0 era was designed and developed with apparently little regard for UI and certainly UX.
      <p>EMRs are a decade behind in technological functionality. It's borderline pathetic that proprietary systems are just now implementing their mobile versions for EMRs while the iPhone will release its 10th operating system this fall.
      <p>We can receive an AMBER alert push notification on our mobile devices, yet a critical Hgb, K+ or INR <i>still</i> requires a login, search for patient name and then parsing through the lab results.</p>

    <div id="tab3" class="js-vertical-tab-content vertical-tab-content">
      <h3>Communication Empathy</h3>
      <p>We've lost the informational trust of our patient population because we either don't engage and explain in a way that that patient can understand or we provide informational resources via channels where our patient's interest is not (i.e. flyers, brochures, billboards).</p>
      <p>Show them you care first; the trust will return later. For the very same reason, this is why ambulatory nursing coordinators have found success with patient engagement in assisting with home-management of chronic diseases such as diabetes.<p>
