        <h3>Progressive Web Apps</h3>
        <p>We need to abandon the notion that building <strong>native apps</strong> for mobile is the answer for improving population health and patient engagement. Our historical track record with regard to tentative adoption innovative IT solutions is enough convincing evidence for me.
        <p>We need to start focusing on the niche of <strong>progressive web apps</strong>. By the time we leverage reasonably functional "apps", the rest of the mobile tech community will be on to something new.
        <p>We need to hop out of line, go around all the noise, and get in line with the pack of developers who have starting building these browser-friendly, lightning-fast apps for other industries.

        <h3>Portability via Open Notes</h3>

        <h3>UX</h3>
        <p>While the rest of the digital world has been focusing on the user interface and experience with their designed products, the healthcare tech seemingly is just now learning what the two-letter UI or UX even mean.
        <p>Worse, the entire meaningful use with EMR 1.0 era was designed and developed with apparently little regard for UI and certainly UX.
        <p>EMRs are a decade behind in technological functionality. It's borderline pathetic that proprietary systems are just now implementing their mobile versions for EMRs while the iPhone will release its 10th operating system this fall.
        <p>We can receive an AMBER alert push notification on our mobile devices, yet a critical Hgb, K+ or INR <i>still</i> requires a login, search for patient name and then parsing through the lab results.</p>

        <h3>Communication Empathy</h3>
        <p>We've lost the informational trust of our patient population because we either don't engage and explain in a way that that patient can understand or we provide informational resources via channels where our patient's interest is not (i.e. flyers, brochures, billboards).</p>
        <p>Show them you care first; the trust will return later. For the very same reason, this is why ambulatory nursing coordinators have found success with patient engagement in assisting with home-management of chronic diseases such as diabetes.<p>
