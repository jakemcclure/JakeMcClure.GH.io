<p>We don&#39;t really talk a lot about design around here. We actually just talk about how things work.</p>

<p>Design is not what it <em>looks</em> like or <em>feels</em> like. Design is <strong>how it works</strong>.</p>

<p>Apple&#39;s core value is that we believe that people with passion can change the world for the better. And that those people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world are the ones that actually do.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s go invent tomorrow instead of worrying about what happened yesterday.</p>

<p>Details matter; it&#39;s worth waiting to get it right.</p>

<p>??? Interesting one --
Why join the navy if you can be a pirate?</p>

<p>You have to be burning with an idea, or a problem, or a wrong that you want to right. If you&#39;re not passionate enough from the start, you&#39;ll never stick it out.</p>

<p>Creativity is just connecting things.</p>

<p>Innovation is the only way to win.</p>

<p>Innovation is not about saying yes to everything. It&#39;s about saying no to all but the most crucial features.</p>

<p>Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do.</p>
