        <title>Casting unstable ankle fractures is still a bad idea</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent JAMA paper titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2565749&quot;&gt;“Close Contact Casting vs Surgery for Initial Treatment of Unstable Ankle Fractures in Older Adults: A Randomized Clinical Trial”&lt;/a&gt; concluded that “casting compared with surgery resulted in similar functional outcomes at 6 months” and that it “may be an appropriate treatment for such patients.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s do some digging to uncover how those are precisely the wrong conclusions the authors should have drawn.
&amp;lt;–excerpt-separator–&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~300 patients randomly assigned to either the surgery or casting group.
However, casts were applied in the OR under general or spinal anesthesia. Similar setup for the surgical group as well.
- If you’re already going to the OR and going to put the patient to sleep, do the surgery.
- As the nonsurgical route showed in this study, 15% of the casting group healed their fracture with unacceptable alignment (malunion).
- 19% of the casting group crossed over because the alignment of the bones just fell apart. This of course means that they now get the luxury of returning to the OR for a second procedure to address the unstable fracture pattern in the surgical manner that should’ve been attempted in the first place.
- The authors want to give themselves a pat-on-the-back for equivalent outcomes in value/satisfaction at 6 months.
  - Only problem: that’s an incredibly short period of time to hang your hat on when it comes to utilitzing this study to make clinical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The UX Prescription</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether a patient or provider, the chorus of dismal usability with our medical records systems is all too common. Development of electronic medical record (EMR) systems desperately need a user experience overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UX for short, it is a foreign concept to concept to clinicians when discussing frustrations with the workflows and lack of functionality with present-day EMRs. While the terminology may be distant, the frustrations are a recurring theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the concept of user experience is old news to virtually every other industry leveraging technology, its place in healthcare has been a colloquial afterthought––better categorized as post-implementation optimization as opposed to pre-development investigation &amp;amp; design thinking. The latter being the more pragmatic approach of the two, we shouldn’t be surprised at the abundance of frustration when pre-implementation usability testing is absent or willfully neglected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, healthcare tech desperately needs a prescription-strength UX overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Floppy Disk UI</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Floppy Disk icons — how much longer until we consider this UI dinosaur no longer applicable? One could argue the shift should have taken place at least a decade ago as I honestly can’t recall using a floppy disk after year 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, remnants of the days when those ole 1.44 MB disks were the mobile storage king still pop up from time to time in the hospital. Spotted in 2014 was this signage in the surgeon’s lounge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;amp-img width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9Sq0uTjDFZEqh2Q4CVJSTA.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those whom may have been perplexed as to why we still struggle with EMR optimization and usability, perhaps, as illustrated above, the level of detail evidently needed to print a photo provides some comical insight.&lt;/p&gt;
