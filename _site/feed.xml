&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patriots.com/schedule-and-stats&quot;&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt; head coach &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick&quot;&gt;Bill Belichick&lt;/a&gt; recently endured a nightmare of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01606KJ6C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mcclure-20&amp;amp;linkId=006492c3f17723a8c1387f57371788b5&quot;&gt;Microsoft Surface tablet&lt;/a&gt; troubleshooting on the sidelines. Needless to say, he would not be a huge fan of the present-day state of EMRs either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full transcript: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patriots.com/news/2016/10/18/bill-belichick-conference-call-transcript-1018&quot;&gt;Belichick on tablet technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Q: Congratulations on becoming a grandfather, Bill. It was reported that there were some issues Sunday with the sideline technology like the headsets and tablets you use. Does that affect the number of plays you guys may be able to call and how does it affect any potential adjustments that you would make over the course of a game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BB: Yeah, well, first of all thank you for your comment there. As you know Phil [Perry], there are multiple communication systems on the sideline. As you probably noticed, I’m done with the tablets. I’ve given them as much time as I can give them. They’re just too undependable for me. I’m going to stick with pictures as several of our other coaches do as well because there just isn’t enough consistency in the performance of the tablets, so I just can’t take it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other communication systems involve the press box to the coaches on the field, and then the coach on the field, the signal caller, or the coach-to-quarterback, coach-to-signal caller system. Those fail on a regular basis. There are very few games that we play, home or away, day, night, cold, hot, preseason, regular season, postseason, it doesn’t make any difference; there are very few games where there aren’t issues in some form or fashion with that equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, there’s a lot of equipment involved, too. There are headsets in the helmets, there’s the belt pack, that communication, there’s a hookup or connection to internet service or that process and so forth with the coaches and the press box. So, there are a number of pieces of equipment, there is a number of connections that are on different frequencies. Again, not that I know anything about this but as it has been explained to me there are a lot of things involved and inevitably something goes wrong somewhere at some point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say weekly we have to deal with something. Dan Famosi is our IT person and he does a great job of handling those things. This is all league equipment so we don’t have it. I mean we use it but it isn’t like we have the equipment during the week and we can work with it and ‘OK, this is a problem. Let’s fix this.’ That’s not how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get the equipment the day of the game, or I’d say not the day of the game but a few hours before the game and we test it and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Usually by game time it is working but I would say not always. And then during the game sometimes something happens and it has to be fixed, and first of all, you have to figure out what the problem is. Is it a battery? Is it the helmet? Is it the coaches’ pack? Is it the battery on the coaches’ pack? I mean you know, again, it could be one of 15 different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I would just say there are problems in every game. There were problems last week but there were problems the week before that, too. Some are worse than others. Sometimes both teams have them, sometimes one team has them and the other doesn’t have them. There’s an equity rule that’s involved there on certain aspects of the communication system but not on all aspects meaning what happens on one side then the other team has to have the same. If ours are down then theirs has to be down and vice versa, but it’s only true in certain aspects of the communication system; not everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall there is a lot of complexity to the technology. There is complexity to multiple systems and there are a lot of failures, and so I know on our end Dan does a great job to fix those as quickly as possible. He has very limited access. I don’t know how much urgency there is on the other part from the league standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However much urgency there is for them to have everything right, I don’t know, I’m not involved with that. But yeah, it was a problem last week. It’s basically a problem every week. The degrees aren’t always the same but we’re usually dealing with something. But as far as the tablet goes, I mean there was an experiment in a couple of the preseason games. It was one preseason game. We actually had two because it was our home game and Carolina’s home game where we had video on the tablets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for me personally, it’s a personal decision, I’m done with the tablets. I’ll use the paper pictures from here on because I’ve given it my best shot. I’ve tried to work through the process but it just doesn’t work for me and that’s because there’s no consistency to it. Long answer to a short question; sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can Virtual Reality Be The Game Changer For The Patient Experience?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Digging in to how leveraging the capabilities of VR can improve the patient experience in &amp;amp; with the healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual reality offers the ultimate escapism. For physicians and other healthcare professionals, it allows us to escape many. historic restraints in medical education &amp;amp; training. It opens up endless possibilities with regard to patient simulated learning (eg team-based crisis learning, surgical simulation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, the patient experience in healthcare arguably stands to benefit even more than medical education. I believe there is an incredible opportunity to enrich the patient experience in &amp;amp; with the healthcare system via leveraging the capabilities of VR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chemotherapy&quot;&gt;Chemotherapy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cancer patients undergoing chemotx, the infusion routine of sitting patiently in a chair surrounded by others persevering through the same battle while IV medications run in can become quite monotonous. For some they are accompanied by friends or family; some go at it alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be psychologically taxing, but VR provides the chance to flip the script. Need some R&amp;amp;R? Travel discouraged because chemotx renders the system immunocompromised? …Bring the R&amp;amp;R to the bedside. Put on a goofy-looking headset and enjoy virtual Bora Bora, for example – turning that infusion center chair into a cabana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking a little adventure? …click a button and head a little south to the Great Barrier Reef or the outback of Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With VR, monotony morphs into marvel.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>UX &amp;mdash; A Prescription For The Quadruple Aim</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether a patient or provider, the chorus of dismal usability with our medical records systems is fortunately becoming a repeated refrain in healthcare conversations regarding the Quadruple Aim and more recently in discussions leading up to the final release of the MACRA. Unfortunately, the cart is being pushed ahead of the horse. The bane of present-day electronic medical record (EMR) systems can be distilled down to two little letters, &lt;strong&gt;UX&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- excerpt --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortened to the abbreviation “UX”, user experience is a buzzword in &amp;amp; around Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;google-trends embed&quot;&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/760_RC04/embed_loader.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; trends.embed.renderExploreWidget(&quot;GEO_MAP_2&quot;, {&quot;comparisonItem&quot;:[{&quot;keyword&quot;:&quot;ux ehr&quot;,&quot;geo&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;today 5-y&quot;},{&quot;keyword&quot;:&quot;ux healthcare&quot;,&quot;geo&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;today 5-y&quot;},{&quot;keyword&quot;:&quot;ux&quot;,&quot;geo&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;today 5-y&quot;},{&quot;keyword&quot;:&quot;mobile ux&quot;,&quot;geo&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;today 5-y&quot;}],&quot;category&quot;:0,&quot;property&quot;:&quot;&quot;}, {&quot;exploreQuery&quot;:&quot;geo=US&amp;q=ux%20ehr,ux%20healthcare,ux,mobile%20ux&quot;}); &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s a foreign concept in the development of healthcare tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;google-trends embed&quot;&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/760_RC04/embed_loader.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; trends.embed.renderExploreWidget(&quot;GEO_MAP_1&quot;, {&quot;comparisonItem&quot;:[{&quot;keyword&quot;:&quot;ux ehr&quot;,&quot;geo&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;today 5-y&quot;},{&quot;keyword&quot;:&quot;ux healthcare&quot;,&quot;geo&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;today 5-y&quot;},{&quot;keyword&quot;:&quot;ux&quot;,&quot;geo&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;today 5-y&quot;},{&quot;keyword&quot;:&quot;mobile ux&quot;,&quot;geo&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;today 5-y&quot;}],&quot;category&quot;:0,&quot;property&quot;:&quot;&quot;}, {&quot;exploreQuery&quot;:&quot;geo=US&amp;q=ux%20ehr,ux%20healthcare,ux,mobile%20ux&quot;}); &lt;/script&gt;

  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/760_RC04/embed_loader.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; trends.embed.renderExploreWidget(&quot;TIMESERIES&quot;, {&quot;comparisonItem&quot;:[{&quot;keyword&quot;:&quot;ux ehr&quot;,&quot;geo&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;today 5-y&quot;},{&quot;keyword&quot;:&quot;ux healthcare&quot;,&quot;geo&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;today 5-y&quot;},{&quot;keyword&quot;:&quot;ux&quot;,&quot;geo&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;today 5-y&quot;},{&quot;keyword&quot;:&quot;mobile ux&quot;,&quot;geo&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;today 5-y&quot;}],&quot;category&quot;:0,&quot;property&quot;:&quot;&quot;}, {&quot;exploreQuery&quot;:&quot;geo=US&amp;q=ux%20ehr,ux%20healthcare,ux,mobile%20ux&quot;}); &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As outlined in an article over the summer, physicians spend an unreasonable amount of time serving as a frustrated data entry clerk. While most of the media focused on the metric of time duration, the user experience with this software is unequivocally the root of the frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the concept of user experience is old news to virtually every other industry leveraging technology, its place in healthcare has been a colloquial afterthought––better categorized as post-implementation optimization as opposed to pre-development investigation &amp;amp; design thinking. The latter being the more pragmatic approach of the two, we shouldn’t be surprised at the abundance of frustration when pre-implementation usability testing is absent or willfully neglected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, healthcare tech desperately needs a prescription-strength UX overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;
