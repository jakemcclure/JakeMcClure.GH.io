        <title>The UX Prescription</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether a patient or provider, the chorus of dismal usability with our medical records systems is all too common. Development of electronic medical record (EMR) systems desperately need a user experience overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UX for short, it is a foreign concept to concept to clinicians when discussing frustrations with the workflows and lack of functionality with present-day EMRs. While the terminology may be distant, the frustrations are a recurring theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the concept of user experience is old news to virtually every other industry leveraging technology, its place in healthcare has been a colloquial afterthought––better categorized as post-implementation optimization as opposed to pre-development investigation &amp;amp; design thinking. The latter being the more pragmatic approach of the two, we shouldn’t be surprised at the abundance of frustration when pre-implementation usability testing is absent or willfully neglected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, healthcare tech desperately needs a prescription-strength UX overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;
