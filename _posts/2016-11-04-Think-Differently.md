A decade ago, the concept of "translational research" provided an academic, practical framework for facilitating medical science discovery. There was an emerging focus on coordinating scientific research and the bedside applicability of such research. The phrase *"Bench to Bedside"* was a well-fitting slogan attached to this new focus in medical research.

The scientific method has always been our broad framework for approaching clinical problems. Translational research merely refined the approach by adding in a component of practicality.

> *practical*: *adj.*  of or concerned with the actual doing or use of something rather than with theory and ideas

It's illogical to approach research and problem-solving in any other way. At the end of the day, if an executed strategy & its results don't move us incrementally closer to a practical solution, then why do we go through these motions in the first place?

In post-Affordable Care Act healthcare, we've seen over the past decade an extremely slow, laggard creep of technological capabilities trickling into both healthcare delivery and our patient's management of acute and chronic illnesses.

As physicians we still communicate via satellite pagers & landlines. The newest, and often critically time-sensitive, patient lab or diagnostic results have yet to be delivered via **push notifications** at scale. Often, the only way for patients to input *patient-generated* or *journaled* data is via handwritten notes scanned into an EMR. Scanned copies, likely, aren't processed with **OCR** technology on the way in rendering them of little archival use. Functionally, patient-generated data is little more than an untagged, unsearchable `stickyNote.jpg`. Even worse, the practice standard for distributing patient records between facilities/providers is via cutting-edge fax machines–a far cry from the [interoperability standards]() the HIT community aspires to.

Obviously, we have a long way to go, but fortunately, we are afforded the strategic gift of extra time since, historically, the rate of technological integration into health care has been rather slow. The initial rollouts of EMRs have been poorly optimized for clinicians and staff. The inability to meet the end-user's needs largely falls on the development of computing tools with little regard or understanding of the users' needs.

As HIT development moves toward integration via APIs, collectively, we need to be much more deliberate on the front end. Strategizing how best to leverage today's tech capabilities to better healthcare delivery for tomorrow begins with understanding the physician, nurse, admin staff or patient's problem.

Because industries outside healthcare have already shown us the fundamental components of successful tech integration, we shouldn't be swinging for the fences. Innovation in healthcare won't be on the backs of one or two homerun hitters. If you're a fan of baseball, you know homerun hitters often lead the league in strikeouts. It's no different out in the wild with healthcare - Exhibit A: see the win/loss stat column of Theranos. Instead, we play "small ball". We build upon the basics.

> *bit*: *noun*, a unit of information expressed in binary notation as either a 0 or 1.

It's a mobile, messaging, voice-controlled, AI-driven world of `bits` out there. We no longer can be solely focused on how to streamline scientific discoveries and clinical research anymore. How we leverage health technology for both patients and providers is the compass from which I write.

Buy the ticket. Take the ride. We've got some work to do.
