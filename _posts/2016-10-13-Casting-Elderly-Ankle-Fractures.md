A recent JAMA paper titled ["Close Contact Casting vs Surgery for Initial Treatment of Unstable Ankle Fractures in Older Adultsâ€“A Randomized Clinical Trial"](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2565749) concluded that "casting compared with surgery resulted in similar functional outcomes at 6 months" and that it "may be an appropriate treatment for such patients."

Now, if you just read the headlines, you would be led to believe the notion, "How could anyone justify surgery for these patients?" Come along, I'll show you.

<!-- excerpt -->

You can glean a whole lot from any study by looking at the author(s) and the journal the research is published in.
~300 patients randomly assigned to either the surgery or casting group.
However, casts were applied in the OR under general or spinal anesthesia. Similar setup for the surgical group as well.
- If you're already going to the OR and going to put the patient to sleep, do the surgery.
- As the nonsurgical route showed in this study, 15% of the casting group healed their fracture with unacceptable alignment (malunion).
- 19% of the casting group crossed over because the alignment of the bones just fell apart. This of course means that they now get the luxury of returning to the OR for a second procedure to address the unstable fracture pattern in the surgical manner that should've been attempted in the first place.
- The authors want to give themselves a pat-on-the-back for equivalent outcomes in value/satisfaction at 6 months.
  - Only problem: that's an incredibly short period of time to hang your hat on when it comes to utilitzing this study to make clinical decisions.
