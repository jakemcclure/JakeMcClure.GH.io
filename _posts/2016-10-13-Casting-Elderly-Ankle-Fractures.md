A recent JAMA paper titled ["Close Contact Casting vs Surgery for Initial Treatment of Unstable Ankle Fractures in Older Adultsâ€“A Randomized Clinical Trial"](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2565749) concluded:

> "Casting compared with surgery resulted in similar functional outcomes at 6 months" and that it "may be an appropriate treatment for such patients."

Follow along, let's dig into the data to see why surgery for these patients is still the better option.
<!-- excerpt -->
So the authors of [this study](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2565749) appropriately recognize and acknowledge "Ankle fractures cause substantial morbidity in older persons." Thus, they set out to assess functional outcomes for this patient population. To do this, they randomized patients older than 60 with an unstable ankle fracture and then blinded the functional outcome assessor to the treatment patient received.

Regardless of randomization, patients received their treatment in the operating room and received either spinal or general anesthesia.
  - That is one expensive cast.
  - A mammoth 20% of patients who were randomized to the casting treatment pathway ended up converting to the surgery treatment arm after they lost the reduction of the ankle joint. (52 of 275 (19%)).
  - These 20% more often than not underwent surgery to fix their problem

Findings postfracture symptoms, quality of life, pain, ankle motion, and mobility, were equivalent at 6 months in both groups.
-  I wouldn't expect large discrepancies in symptoms this soon after an injury & recovery.

Infection and wound breakdown were more common with surgery.
- This is almost always true for any disease or injury.
- Benefits and risks of surgery > casting
- Infection and wound breakdown were more common with surgery (29/298 [10%] vs 4/275 [1%]

Also reported to be "more common with surgery" was the need for additional operating room procedures. They quote the statistic of this occuring in 18/298 patients [6%] for surgery and 3/275 patients [1%] for casting. However, we already know that nearly 20% converted out of the casting pathway to manage their failed fracture healing. The stat they did provide reveals a 5-fold increase in poor alignment of the ankle joint. (Radiologic malunion was more common in the casting group (38/249 [15%] vs 8/274 [3%] for surgery)

You can glean a whole lot from any study by looking at the author(s) and the journal the research is published in.
- ~300 patients randomly assigned to either the surgery or casting group.

However, casts were applied in the OR under general or spinal anesthesia. Similar setup for the surgical group as well.
- If you're already going to the OR and going to put the patient to sleep, do the surgery.
- As the nonsurgical route showed in this study, 15% of the casting group healed their fracture with unacceptable alignment (malunion).
- 19% of the casting group crossed over because the alignment of the bones just fell apart. This of course means that they now get the luxury of returning to the OR for a second procedure to address the unstable fracture pattern in the surgical manner that should've been attempted in the first place.
- The authors want to give themselves a pat-on-the-back for equivalent outcomes in value/satisfaction at 6 months.
  - Only problem: that's an incredibly short period of time to hang your hat on when it comes to utilitzing this study to make clinical decisions.
