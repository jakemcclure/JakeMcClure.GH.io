<li><p>From 2013 to 2014, 8 U.S. states (<strong>MA, ME, NH, OH, FL, KY, MD</strong> and <strong>NC</strong>) had large increases in overdose deaths tied to synthetic opioids. (The researchers used these deaths as an indicator of deaths from fentanyl) </p></li>
<li>6 of these states specifically reported fentanyl-related deaths, and the combined fentanyl-related deaths in these states increased from <strong>392</strong> deaths in 2013 to <strong>1,400</strong> deaths in 2014 (<strong>257% increase</strong>).

<ul>
<li>During that same time, the number of drug products that tested positive for fentanyl after being seized by law enforcement officers increased from 293 to 3,340 (<strong>1040% increase</strong>).</li>
<li><p>The findings suggest that illegally manufactured fentanyl is driving the increase in fentanyl-related deaths. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What tips you off to fentanyl driving the overdose problem is what I&#8217;ve called the OD:Death ratio. Basically anywhere where first responders have access to Narcan, you see this monster jump in ODs in like 2014&#8211;15 but the increase in actual deaths isn&#8217;t proportional. So the media will tell you, &#8220;Narcan is saving lives&#8221; &#8230;which it is, but I&#8217;m asking &#8220;Why is there a jump in ODs to begin with?&#8221; &#8230;the answer, of course, is that users don&#8217;t know how potent the heroin may actually be. A couple fentanyl micrograms here&#8230;a couple there&#8230;this is where human cartel-as-a-pharmacist errors are costing people their life. </p>

<li><p>As more fentanyl was sold illegally on the streets, the number of fatal overdoses jumped 79 percent in 27 states from 2013 to 2014, while law enforcement seizures of the drug increased 426 percent in eight of those 27 states. </p></li>
<li><p>But evidence indicates that illicitly made fentanyl is more likely a powder mixed with heroin and or sold as heroin,&#8220; Recently, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration reported that synthetic fentanyl was showing up mixed with prescription narcotic painkillers, and &#8221;this is a new and emerging threat,&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>For example, heroin spiked with fentanyl may be responsible for 75 overdoses in Indiana and Ohio since last Friday. More than 30 overdoses occurred in Cincinnati last weekend, with 33 more overdoses &#8211; including one death &#8211; in the city since Tuesday. </p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s likely that the heroin being distributed on the streets in the recent string of overdoses in Cincinnati may have contained such illicitly manufactured compounds as carfentanil and a drug known as W&#8211;18,&#8221; </p></li>
<li><p>Both compounds are most likely manufactured in China and sold online to dealers in the United States, who use them to produce the heroin and fake Oxycontin pills they sell on the street, he said.</p></li>
<li><p>Carfentanil, which is used as an elephant tranquilizer, and W&#8211;18 are nearly 10,000 times more potent than morphine, he noted. And W&#8211;18 is almost 100 times more potent than fentanyl </p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;People who buy heroin from dealers on the street may not even be aware that they are taking the drug,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Dealers often cut their heroin with such synthetic drugs to make their supply last longer, while also making it more potent.&#8221; </p></li>
<li><p>fentanyl is so toxic that a single dose of naloxone might not be enough to reverse an overdose</p></li>
</ul>

<p>From 2013 to 2014, fentanyl-related deaths more than doubled in Florida (from 185 deaths to 397 deaths) and rose by more than six times in Ohio (from 84 deaths to 526 deaths). </p>

<p>And this is when Fentanyl is just starting to become popular. Take a look at a few recent tweets where I showcase some graphs that just take the CDC&#8217;s data and more visually convey the dynamics of the market.<br/>
1. I made this because I knew the data told a different story than just a bunch of upsloping line graphs. Knowing that the market shifted away from actual overdoses due to pain pills, I calc&#8217;d the % change in # of deaths for each year relative to the year prior: the yr-to-yr % change. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Covsh-8XgAIioUh.jpg">For pain pills</a>, there&#8217;s not a whole lot of dynamic change from 2007 to the present. That&#8217;s not surprising because that&#8217;s about when MD awareness was catching on. FL cracks down on pill mills in 2010 with effects seen in 2011 (lo and behold look at that chart!!! yr-to-yr change in 2012 is in the negative just as you would expect)<br/>
2. then looking yr-to-yr for heroin, when the market shifts away from the more tightly regulated oxycontin, you&#8217;d anticipate a jump &#8230;.<a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CovzIViW8AA3-m1.jpg">and TADA!!!!</a><br/>
3. so then to get this revelation side-by-side with pain pills I ended up coming up with what I&#8217;ve called the <a href="https://twitter.com/jake_mcclure/status/767154720758792192">Pills versus Heroin</a> - <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CqV7JiuXYAAHzSa.jpg">Bubble Chart</a> where the area of the bubble proportionally corresponds to # of overdose deaths. </p>

<p>Officers have also recently seized large numbers of counterfeit pills that contain illegally manufactured fentanyl, the report said. <strong>This suggests that there could soon be an increase in fentanyl-related deaths in places where people commonly take &#8220;diverted prescription pills&#8221; (pills that are prescribed to someone else), because people may take the counterfeit pills without knowing it</strong>. </p>
