Floppy Disk icons — how much longer until we consider this UI dinosaur no longer applicable? One could argue the shift should have taken place at least a decade ago as I honestly can’t recall using a floppy disk after year 2000.

Yet, remnants of the days when those ole 1.44 MB disks were the mobile storage king still pop up from time to time in the hospital. Spotted in 2014 was this signage in the surgeon’s lounge:

For those whom may have been perplexed as to why we still struggle with EMR optimization and usability, perhaps, as illustrated above, the level of detail evidently needed to print a photo provides some comical insight.
