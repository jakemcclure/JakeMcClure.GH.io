## On Wakefield's Initial study
- "We took histories including details of immunisations and exposure to infectious diseases, and assessed the children. In 11 cases the history was obtained by the senior clinician (JW-S). Neurological and psychiatric assessments were done by consultant staff (PH, MB) with HMS-4 criteria.1 Developmental histories included a review of prospective developmental records from parents, health visitors, and general practitioners. Four children did not undergo psychiatric assessment in hospital; all had been assessed professionally elsewhere, so these assessments were used as the basis for their behavioural diagnosis."
- "Both the presence of intestinal inflammation and absence of detectable neurological abnormality in our children are consistent with an exogenous influence upon cerebral function. Lucarelli’s observation that after removal of a provocative enteric antigen children achieved symptomatic behavioural improvement, suggests a reversible element in this condition."
- "Rubella virus is associated with autism and the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (rather than monovalent measles vaccine) has also been implicated. Fudenberg noted that for 15 of 20 autistic children, the first symptoms developed within a week of vaccination. Gupta commented on the striking association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination and the onset of behavioural symptoms in all the children that he had investigated for regressive autism. Measles virus and measles vaccination have both been implicated as risk factors for Crohn’s disease..."
- "We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described. If there is a causal link between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and this syndrome, a rising incidence might be anticipated after the introduction of this vaccine in the UK in 1988. Published evidence is inadequate to show whether there is a change in incidence or a link with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. A genetic predisposition to autistic-spectrum disorders is suggested by over-representation in boys and a greater concordance rate in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins."
- "Urinary methylmalonic-acid concentrations were raised in most of the children, a finding indicative of a functional vitamin B12 deficiency. Although vitamin B12 concentrations were normal, serum B12 is not a good measure of functional B12 status. Vitamin B12 is essential for myelinogenesis in the developing central nervous system, a process that is not complete until around the age of 10 years. B12 deficiency may, therefore, be a contributory factor in the developmental regression."
- His concluding paragraph: "We have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction. In most cases, onset of symptoms was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation. Further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine."

### Commentary
- The study is a small analysis of 12 subjects that Wakefield claims had evidence of the measles virus in their GI tract and that this correlated with the MMR vaccine and the onset of autism.
- The techniques used to identify measles virus in the GI tracts were later disputed and failed to replicate.
- Review of records also disputes the timing of the onset of symptoms and the MMR vaccine.
- Wakefield had undisclosed conflicts of interest.
  - Patent application for a replacement MMR vaccine.
  - Consultant for an attorney looking to sue the manufacturers of the MMR vaccine.
  - Many of the subjects of this study were childen of clients of this attorney.


## Case-control study investigating the association proposed by Wakefield
Mrozek-Budzyn D; Kieltyka A; Majewska R Lack of Association Between Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccination and Autism in Children: A Case-Control Study. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal: 1 December 2009. [doi: 10.1097/INF.0b013e3181c40a8a](http://journals.lww.com/pidj/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2010&issue=05000&article=00003&type=abstract)
This is a retrospective case-control study conducted in Poland that found no correlation between autism and either the single measles vaccine or the trivalent MMR vaccine. In fact, there appeared to be a protective effect in that there was less autism in those who were vaccinated. This is likely either a random result or the result of an unknown confounder. However, this study does not reflect any increased risk of autism in those receiving either type of vaccine.

## Prospective Lancet Finnish study published in the same year as Wakefield's
Peltola H, Patja A, Leinikki P, et al. No evidence for measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine-associated inflammatory bowel disease or autism in a 14-year prospective study. Lancet, May 2 1998, 351(9112) p1327-8.
This study showed that, with over a decade’s effort to detect all severe adverse events associated with MMR vaccine, no data could be found supporting the hypothesis that it would cause pervasive developmental disorder or inflammatory bowel disease.
- 3 million doses of MMR between 1982-1996 in Finland
- Follow-up interval = 1y4m – 15y5m (mean 10y8m)
- 31 children developed GI symptoms (30 after the first dose)
  - In this study, a child had a 0.001% chance of developing GI symptoms after vaccination.
- Interval between MMR and symptoms = 20h – 15d
- 1 episode of Guillain-Barré syndrome
-  5 children +febrile seizures
- 2 children +headaches
- 0 reported cases of autism
